- Title: Plastics 01 A
  Cloze:
     Plastic is a material widely used in almost everything. In brief, 
     the word means "pliable and easily {shaped}."<br>  
     This material’s plasticity or plastic deformation makes it possible
     to be pressed, {moulded}, or extruded into solid objects of various
     {shapes}.

- Title: Plastics 01 B
  Cloze:
     "3D printers used two main technologies:<br>
     {Powder} bed fusion: the printers that use this technology compact
     masses of powder in layers.<br>
     Extrusion {deposition}: with this technology, the desire shape is
     created by adding the material in layers on a print bed."

- Title: Plastics 01 C
  Cloze:
     Plastics are materials formed by chains of {carbon} and hydrogen
     atoms. We call these chains {polymers}, while the atoms that form
     them are called {monomers}.

- Title: Plastics 01 D
  Cloze:
     Thermoplastic materials are plastics that are {softened} by
     heating, and can be formed and {melted} as many times as we like.

- Title: Plastics 01 E
  Cloze:
     Elastomers are very {flexible} materials that recover their shape
     and {dimensions} when external forces stop acting on them.

- Title: Plastics 01 F
  Cloze:
     Elastomers degrade easily with the {heat} and cannot be re-melted
     once they have been {formed}. 

- Title: Plastics 01 G
  Cloze:
     Thermoset plastics can be {shaped} using heat; however, once they
     have been formed, they cannot be re-melted to {create} different
     forms.

- Title: Plastics 01 H
  Cloze:
     "{Extrusion}: this procedure is used with thermoplastics to obtain
     long products, {pipes}, profiles, etc."

- Title: Plastics 01 I
  Cloze:
     Plastics are extremely useful but they generate large quantities
     of {waste} that build up on the surface of the Earth.<br>
     Unlike other materials (such as wood), plastics are mainly 
     {non-biodegradable}; this means that they do not degrade over time.

- Title: Plastics 01 J
  Cloze:
     Thermoplastics are washed, ground up and fed into an {extruder},
     which uses heat to {melt} them in order to make new parts. 
     We call this process mechanical {recycling}.

- Title: Plastics 01 K
  Cloze:
     "Plastics used in 3D printing, PLA or ABS:<br>
     {PLA}: this plastic is created from natural materials such as corn,
     starch and sugar cane.<br>
     {ABS}: a very tough, hard and rigid plastic. It can withstand high
     temperatures and is easy to paint.<br>
     {ABS}: it has a very high melting point and must be heated to
     230-260ºC for use in additive manufacturing.<br>
     {PLA}: it is biodegradable and does not release toxic gases when
     it is used in printing. This material is also much more difficult
     to machine and paint than {ABS}."

- Title: Plastics 01 L
  Cloze:
     A 3D printer is a machine that can print figures with {volume}
     from a computer design.<br>
     Because {thermoplastic} materials are easy to mould and form 
     they are used in 3D printing, also called additive manufacturing.
